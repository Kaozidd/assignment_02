		<h1>Hello.</h1>
		<p>Mark Boulton Design was a small studio. In 2014, <a href="#">we were aquired by Monotype.</a></p>
		<p>Over the years, we <a href="#">built an amazing team </a>and worked on some <a href="#">tremendous projects with the smartest clients</a>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful for. But, it's time for a change.</p>
		<p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we want to fix. Mark Boulton Design is now closed. The team will be working on Monotype projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll still be writing, still blogging, and still speaking at web conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p>
